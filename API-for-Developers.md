API is an important component in OpenHub to allow its services to be consumed and interact with by external party, namely:

  * **Developer** - external developer applied thru online, like hackathon participants, app developers, startups
  * **Partner** - fundamentally are developer as well but with access to additional scope as they are trusted partners with api contract signed
  * **User** - user can only access the api thru the above two entity: either partner or developer. Eg: a normal user that like to access his own information thru API has to register as a developer with us
