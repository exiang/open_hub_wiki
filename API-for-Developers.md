API is an important component in OpenHub to allow its services to be consumed and interact with by external party, namely:

  * **Developer** - external developer who applied for access thru online, like hackathon participants, app developers, startups.
  * **Partner** - fundamentally are external developer too but with access to additional scope as NDA and contract signed and enforced.
  * **User** - user can only access the API thru the above two entity: either partner or developer. Eg: a normal user that like to access his own information thru API has to register as a developer with us

## Swagger
