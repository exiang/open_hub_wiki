To get started with OpenHub, you will need to setup a local development environment where you can modify code and test it live on browser.

  * AWS S3
  * Elasticsearch

  * OS - Apple Mac
  * IDE - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * GIT Client - [Fork](https://git-fork.com/)
  * API Gateway - [TYK.io](https://tyk.io/)

## Environment

  * Production - this is your live site (e.g. https://central.mymagic.my)

## Setup with Docker
To setup Docker on local development server, we highly recommend using docker than the manual way. Use docker from repo: magic_docker7. Refer to the setup documents there
