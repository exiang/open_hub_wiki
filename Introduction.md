OpenHub was conceived so that third-party modules could easily build upon its foundations, making it an extremely customizable Startup ecosystem management software.

## Concepts
You should be familiar with PHP and Object-Oriented Programming before attempting to write your own module.

A module is an extension to OpenHub that enables any developer to add the following:

  * Provide additional functionality to OpenHub.
  * Communicate with other services (Acuity Scheduling, Futurelab, Envoy).
